This Repo is a fork of [bacongobbler/helm-whatup][], because the original project is no longer actively further developed.

This is a Helm plugin to help users determine if there's an update available for their installed charts.
It works by reading your locally cached index files from the chart repositories (via `helm repo update`) and checking
the version against the latest deployed version of your charts in the Kubernetes cluster.

## Support

| `whatup` Version | Supported helm version |
|------------------|------------------------|
| 0.2.x            | 2.x                    |
| >= 0.3.x         | 3.x                    |

_NOTE: If you use a helm v3 Client you need to install the latest `whatup` Version!_

## Usage

```bash
helm repo update
helm whatup
```

## Example

Example output of `helm whatup`:

```bash
NAME                       	NAMESPACE	INSTALLED VERSION	LATEST VERSION	CHART
atlassian-confluence-server	devops   	1.0.4            	1.0.5         	atlassian-confluence-server
atlassian-crucible         	devops   	0.1.1            	0.1.3         	atlassian-crucible
atlassian-jira-software    	devops   	0.3.10           	0.3.11        	atlassian-jira-software
confluence-mysql           	devops   	1.4.0            	1.6.2         	mysql
fileshare                  	devops   	1.7.0            	1.9.1         	nextcloud
fileshare-postgres         	devops   	6.2.1            	8.1.2         	postgresql
```

## Install

```bash
helm plugin install https://github.com/fabmation-gmbh/helm-whatup
```

The above will fetch the latest binary release of `helm whatup` and install it.


### Developer (From Source) Install

If you would like to handle the build yourself, instead of fetching a binary, this is how recommend doing it.

First, set up your environment:

- You need to have [Go](http://golang.org) installed. Make sure to set `$GOPATH`

Clone this repo into your `$GOPATH` using git.

```bash
mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabmation-gmbh
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabmation-gmbh
git clone https://github.com/fabmation-gmbh/helm-whatup
```

Then run the following to get running.

```bash
cd helm-whatup
make bootstrap build
SKIP_BIN_INSTALL=1 helm plugin install $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabmation-gmbh/helm-whatup
```

That last command will skip fetching the binary install and use the one you
built.
